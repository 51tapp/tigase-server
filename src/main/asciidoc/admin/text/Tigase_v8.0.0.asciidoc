Tigase XMPP Server 8.0.0 Change notes and announcement

== Major Changes

=== Kernel and beans configuration
Tigase now operates using a Kernel and Beans style of programming. What does this mean for Tigase and You? Good news, really.
Tigase XMPP Server is now working as a Kernel program, which will operate on it's own and handle all the core functionality of the server. Component, and non-essential functionality will now be loaded as Beans. As a user, your experience will not change all that much. However, beans can be loaded and unloaded without having to restart Tigase, meaning that the program will behave more dynamically. This means a smaller footprint on memory on resources when components are not needed, and longer uptimes without having to rest art the program! This also allows for greater flexibility for Tigase XMPP Server to be better customized for unique solutions.

=== New Configuration File Format
With the change of Tigase to a Kernel and Beans style of programming, we have also changed how the configuration file is managed. Although you will still edit the `config.tdsl` file like a plaintext file, a new style of formatting will be used known as DSL.
Domain Specific Language may add more lines, but is a cleaner format, and provides a more secure configuration design since validation of the configuration is done at the domain level.
For more information on this format and how to configure Tigase, visit xref:dslConfig[DSL Configuration Guide].

=== Cluster Node Shutdown Changes
Starting with Tigase XMPP Server 8.0.0, users connected on clustered nodes will be able use a `see-other-host` strategy when a node is being shutdown. *Note: This may not be compatible with all clients.*
The Ad-hoc command is designed for a graceful shutdown of cluster nodes as a groovy script `Shutdown.groovy`.
This script also allows for the -timeout setting which will delay shutdown of the node, and alert all users (via a headline message) that the server will be shutdown after a time. User clients that are compatible with the command will then detect other connected clusters and maintain their connections.

If the command is being sent to shut down the whole cluster, no `see-other-host` implementation will be sent, however timeout settings may still be used.

The script may be activated by an ad-hoc command, or sent using REST from remote or Tigase Admin UI.

=== Significant cleanup of code and repositories
Multiple changes have been made to the structure and coding for v8, many related to trimming size of repositories and old calls. Some of these improvements are listed here:

- Empty JavaDocs that do not convey values have been removed.
- All code is reformatted to be compliant with out xref:tigaseCodeStyle[codestyle guidelines].
- Calls to `System.out.print*()` and `printStackTrace()` have been removed from code.
- Depreciated and unused classes have been removed.

=== BouncyCastle being used for StartTLS
link:https://www.bouncycastle.org/java.html[BouncyCastle] Crypto API has now been employed to handle StartTLS negotiation. By doing this, Tigase now supports `tls-unique` within the SCRAM PLUS authentication implementation.
This API is may be employed by calling the class in your configuration file:
[source,dsl]
-----
c2s () {
    sslContextContainer(class: tigase.extras.bcstarttls.BCSSLContextContainer) {}
}
-----
The BouncyCastle classes are included in the dist-max archives.

=== default-virtual-host property changes
Default virtual hosts property is now able to be configured only as a domain name instead of the list of virtual host domains with options. Additional virtual host domains and their options need to be configured using ad-hoc commands or web AdminUI. Reference xref:virtHosts[Virtual-Hosts Configuration] for more details.

=== All artifacts are signed
Since work began on v8.0.0 Tigase has required that all changes to Tigase XMPP Server and dependencies be signed with known certificates. This version marks the first to be totally signed.

=== Scaled Down Installation Methods
We have cleaned up installation methods for Tigase and now recommend the use of web-installer method. IzPack installer (files `tigase-server-<version>-b<build>.jar` installation methods have been removed and will no longer be produced for v8.0.0 and later.
Manual installation is still available for those unable to use HTTP or browser access. Visit our xref:quickstart[Quick Start] guide for instructions on these other methods.

=== Emojis now supported on Tigase XMPP Servers
Emojis are now supported on MySQL databases, however some settings may be need to be changed, although they won't affect existing databases. xref:emojisupportSQL[Visit this section] for details.

=== XEP-0215 External Service Discovery now supported
Tigase now supports link:https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0215.html[XEP-0215 - External Service Discovery] allowing Tigase to discover services that are not available VIA the XMPP Protocol. For setup and configuration information visit xref:_tigase_external_service_discovery[External Service Discovery Component] documentation.

=== XEP-0313 Message Archive Management now supported
link:https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0313.html[XEP-0313 - Message Archive Management] is now supported by Tigase featuring custom enhancements like full-text search and searching by tags. MAM requires Tigase's message archive to be enabled in the `config.tdsl` file, and the schema (XEP-0136 or XEP-0313) must be configured in session manager settings.
To turn on MAM, see configuration guide xref:_support_for_mam[located here].

=== XEP-0363 HTTP File Upload now supported
link:https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0363.html[XEP-0363 - HTTP File Upload] is now supported using Tigase HTTP API component now allowing for a more robust one-to-many file uploading option. Configuration details are available at the xref:XEP0363[HTTP File Upload Component] section of documentation.

=== Startup now uses bootstrapping
Tigase now uses bootstrapping to startup, which will load configuration from `config.tdsl` file like before. Then Tigase will begin it's normal operations with the configuration options. All startup functions for Tigase will now run under the `bootstrap` bean.

=== CAPTCHA system now available for in-band registration
link:https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0077.html[XEP-0077 In band registration] can use Data Forms as an option to process new registrations. Now you can secure these registrations by employing a CAPTCHA solution. By enabling this option you can reduce the number of potential spammers and bots on your server.

=== Schema changes
Now each component has it's own schema for databases, they are no longer tied into Tigase XMPP server versions making changes and updates to individual components easier, and may not disrupt all users not using certain components. See the xref:schemaChangev800[schema update section] for more details.

=== Shrinkable Statistics History
Statistics history can now be automatically made smaller if a systems memory resources are above a certain amount. By default this is enabled and will trigger when over 95% of memory is in use. Half of all existing entries will be removed at this time.
The same pattern will continue to halve the available records every time the threshold is met. A hard-set minimum of 5 entries is set, so you will always have the last 5 entries.
This setting may be adjusted by adding the following setting to your `config.tdsl` file and adjusting the integer value:
[source,dsl]
-----
stats() {
  'stats-high-memory-level' = 95
}
-----

=== Statistics now available for all modules
For any bean, you may enable statistics by using the following
[source,dsl]
-----
bean (class) {
  statistics = true
}
-----

=== Spam Protection
Tigase XMPP Server v8.0.0 now includes some efforts to prevent spam bot accounts from running on servers.

==== Account Registration Limits Expanded
Account registration limits have been expanded and now you can set separate counters, or configure components individually for their own limits. Visit xref:accountRegLimit[this section] for configuration details.

==== Accounts created using in-band registration now will use confirmation E-mail
In an effort to create a more secure method for implementing `JabberIqRegister` Tigase XMPP Server will now require the use of a confirmation E-mail by default in the process. The E-mail must be valid, and accounts will be made into pending status until a user clicks the generated URI in the E-mail and activates the account.
This is a plugin and must be enabled in the `config.tdsl` file by using the following code:
[source,properties]
-----
'account-registration-email-validator'() {}
-----

==== Further Spam prevention
Tigase-spam component is now in `dist-max` distribution package, and has a number of features described here xref:tigase_spam_filter[in this section].

=== Changes in password storage
Before version 8.0.0, user passwords were stored in plaintext in the `user_pw` database field within `tig_users` table, but in plaintext.
It was possible to enable storage of the MD5 hash of the password instead, however this limited authentication mechanism SASL PLAIN only.
However an MD5 hash of a password is not really a secure method as it is possible to revert this mechanism using rainbow tables.

Therefore, we decided to change this and store only encrypted versions of a password in `PBKDF2` form which can be easily used for `SCRAM-SHA-1` authentication mechanism or `SCRAM-SHA-256`.
`SASL PLAIN` mechanism can also use these encrypted passwords.

The storage of encrypted passwords is now enabled *by default* in v8.0.0 of Tigase.

=== Dynamic TLS Buffer
Memory Buffer for TLS no longer remains at highest buffer size needed for the server session. Buffer will now free memory during idle connections. Thus drastically improving program footprint.

=== XEP-305 Quickstart now supported

It's now possible to establish connection faster due to implementation of https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0305.html[XEP-0305: XMPP Quickstart] (https://projects.tigase.net/issues?q=Redmine%20ID:%201936[#1936]). Feature is only available for `c2s` Connection Manager (i.e. connections on port 5222) and needs to be enabled in `config.tdsl`

[source,dsl]
-----
c2s () {
    'pipelining' = true
}
-----

=== Database Timestamps
Timestamps in database will be stored using UTC time.

=== Config-type properties have changed
Config-type is now configured using DSL format. Visit xref:configType[this section] for more information.
The names of different config-type properties have changed:
`default` replaces `--gen-config-def`, `--gen=config-all`, and `--gen-config-default` configuration types.
`session-manager` replaces `--gen-config-sm`.
`connection-managers` replaces `--gen-config-cs`.
`component` replaces `--gen-config-comp`.
`setup` - is a new type of config created for initial configuration of Tigase XMPP Server.

NOTE: Old versions are no longer supported, you HAVE to replace old versions with the new ones manually when upgrading to v8.0.0.

=== Database Watchdog implemented
It is now possible to set connection testing to databases when connections are idle and customize the frequency with which this is done. Visit xref:databaseWatchdog[this section] for more details.

=== Packet statistics expanded
Packet statistics both retrieved VIA XMPP and during graceful shutdown have now been separated to a per-XMLNS basis. This may be disabled by adding the following line to `config.tdsl` file:
[source,dsl]
----
'detailed-other-statistics' = false
----

=== XEP-0016 Behavior changes
XEP states that Privacy lists should be used when no user session exists in addition to when there is. Previously, Tigase would only filter results when retrieving messages, allowing blocked users to store offline messages. This has now been changed to reflect the XEP properly, and messages will be filtered while there is no user session. If however, you wish to use the previous version, where offline messages are cached first and then filtered, you may use the following configuration:
[source,dsl]
-----
'sess-man' {
    'jabber:iq:privacy' () {
        privacyListOfflineCache (active: true) {
          size = 20000
        }
    }
}
-----
By default, the cache has a limit of 10000 entries, that may be set by using size bean as seen above.

=== Access Control List has new ACL modifiers
New permissions have been added to ACL including `DOMAIN_OWNER` and `DOMAIN_ADMIN` to reduce permissions checking, and add another level of fine-grained permissions. For more details, please see xref:accessControlList[Tigase ACL] configuration for more details.

=== Option to ignore schema-version check added
You can now skip the schema check phase for individual databases. To do this, add the following do the datasource configuration block:
[source,dsl]
-----
DataSource () {
  default () {
    'schema-management' = false
  }
}
-----

This will do the following:

- Print a warning during repository startup.
- Skip schema upgrades for the source.
- Skip schema destruction for the source.

=== Protection against brute-force attacks

Version 8.0.0 improves security by preventing brute-force attacks. Feature needs to be explicitly enabled and configured (on per VHost basis). Detailed configuration is described in <<bruteForcePrevention>> (https://projects.tigase.net/issues?q=Redmine%20ID:%208160[#8160])
