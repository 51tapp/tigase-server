:version: v2.1, August 2017: Reformatted for Kernel/DSL

*Default value:* `true`

*Example:* `'vhost-anonymous-enabled' = 'false'`

*Possible values:* `true|false`

*Description:* The `vhost-anonymous-enabled` property specifies whether anonymous user logins are allowed for the installation for all vhosts.

This is a global property which is overridden by settings for particular VHost (see <<addManageDomain>>).

Default settings for all virtual hosts are used when this property is not defined. This settings is useful mostly for installations with many virtual hosts listed in the `config.tdsl` file for which there is no individual settings specified. It allows the configuration of default values for all of them, instead of having to provide individual configuration for each VHost.

*Available since:* 8.0.0
