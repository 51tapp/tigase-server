:version: v2.0, June 2017: Reformatted for Kernel/DSL

*Default value:* `secure`

*Example:* `'hardened-mode' = secure`

*Possible values:* `relaxed|secure|strict`

*Description:* Adjusting hardened mode affects handling of security aspects within Tigase. The higher the level the more strict are the rules:
  * `relaxed` - uses default security capabilities from installed JVM;
  * `secure` - disables old SSLv2 and SSLv3, disables weak cyphers;
  * `strict` - in addition to `secure` level changes it also disables `TLSv1` and `TLSv1.1` as well as ciphers that don't support Forward secrecy.

On older JVM versions it required link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce-7-download-432124.html[UnlimitedJCEPolicyJDK] installed. It's not required with OpenJDK8 and newer an OracleJVM 11 and newer.

*Available since:* 5.2.0
