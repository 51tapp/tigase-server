From release of v7.0.1, users and commercial clients alike may now be able to register and request a license file from our servers on thier own.
This process helps us maintain licenses, and can allow for client installations of new servers without the need to wait for a license file.
Users who do not wish to register will not be required too, Tigase XMPP Server will still be available free under AGPLv3. However, if you are a regular user of Tigase XMPP Server, you may wish to register for your own free version license.

== Registering for a License
To obtain a license from our licensing servers, you will first need to register with our server.  This may be done by using our web portal.

=== Web Portal
Pointing your browser to link:http://license.tigase.net:8080/rest/licence/register[license.tigase.net:8080/rest/licence/register] will give you the following page:

Fill out the three required forms, your name, an E-mail where you will receive the license, and answer the math problem, to prove you are a human.

Once filled out, you will be greeted with the following screen:
