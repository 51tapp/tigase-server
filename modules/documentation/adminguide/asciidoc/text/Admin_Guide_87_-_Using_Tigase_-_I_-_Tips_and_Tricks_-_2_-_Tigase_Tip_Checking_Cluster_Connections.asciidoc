After setting up clustering you may want to verify that the clusters are operational. Right now it can be done in two manners - first by checking that there are actual network connections established between cluster nodes. The other is to check internal status of the server.

Established connections
-----------------------

There are number of ways to check for opened connections, simplest one use command line. (Tigase uses port _5277_ for cluster connections)

* Linux
[source,sh]
-------------------------------------
$ lsof -iTCP:5277 -sTCP:ESTABLISHED -P -n
-------------------------------------

* Windows
[source,sh]
-------------------------------------
C:\WINNT>netstat -anp tcp | find ":5277 "
-------------------------------------

Cluster nodes connected (using XMPP)
------------------------------------

Verifying clustering connectivity over XMPP protocol requires any XMPP client capable of http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0030.html[XEP-0030: Service Discovery]. It's essential to remember that only an administrator (a user whose JID is configured as administrative) has access.

Psi XMPP Client
---------------

For the purpose of this guide a http://psi-im.org/[Psi] client will be used. After successfully configuring and connecting to account with administrative privileges we need to access _Service Discovery_, either from application menu or from context menu of the particular account account:

In the _Service Discovery_ window we need to find _Cluster Connection Manager_ component. After expanding the tree node for the component a list of all cluster nodes will be presented with the current status (either _connected_ or _disconnected_). Node column will contain actual hostname of the cluster node:
