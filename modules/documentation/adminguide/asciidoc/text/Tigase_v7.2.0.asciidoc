Tigase v7.2.0 Changenotes and announcement

:toc:

Major Changes
-------------

Cluster Node Shutdown Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Starting with Tigase v7.2.0, users connected on clustered nodes will be able use a +see-other-host+ strategy when a node is being shutdown.  *Note: This may not be compatible with all clients.*
The Ad-hoc command is designed for a graceful shutdown of cluster nodes as a groovy script Shutdown.groovy.
This script also allows for the -timeout setting which will delay shutdown of the node, and alert all users (via a headline message) that the server will be shutdown after a time.  User clients that are compatible with the command will then detect other connected clusters and maintain their connections.

If the command is being sent to shut down the whole cluster, no +see-other-host+ implementation will be sent, however -timeout settings may still be used.

The script may be activated by an ad-hoc command, or sent using REST from remote or Tigase Admin UI.

Shrinkable Statistics History
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Statistics history can now be automatically made smaller if a systems memory resources are above a certain amount.  By default this is enabled and will trigger when over 95% of memory is in use.  Half of all existing entries will be removed at this time.
The same pattern will continue to halve the available records every time the threshold is met.  A hard-set minimum of 5 entries is set, so you will always have the last 5 entries.
This setting may be adjusted by adding the following setting to your init.properties file and adjusting the integer value:
