== Snapshot Compilation and Snapshot Package Generation
- `mvn compile` - compilation of the snapshot package
- `mvn package` - create snapshot jar file
- `mvn install` - install in local repository shanpshot jar file
- `mvn deploy` - deploy to the remote repository snapshot jar file

== Release Compilation, Generation

- `mvn release:prepare` prepare the project for a new version release
- `mvn release:perform` execute new version release generation

== Generating tar.gz, tar.bz2 File With Sources Only

- `mvn -DdescriptorId=src assembly:assembly`

Any of these commands will work when your commandline is in a directory with a pom.xml file.  This file will instruct what Maven will do.
